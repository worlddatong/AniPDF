**AniPDF** is a graphical user interface (GUI) software  to process anisotropic total scattering data interactively. 

The extraction of the X-ray PDF data is usually based on angular integrations of isotropic X-ray structure functions, which is no longer valid for the anisotropic responses of the materials under orientation-dependent stimuli, such as electric field and stress. AniPDF, based on the spherical harmonic method, provides an ideal tool to investigate the local structural change under the application of external stimuli.
