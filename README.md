# Introduction
AniPDF is a graphical user interface (GUI) software based on the spherical harmonic method to process anisotropic total scattering data interactively.
AniPDF can be employed together with other process programs such as Fit2D and PDFgetX2 to obtain anisotropic PDFs from 2D diffraction patterns.

# Installation
Executable versions for Windows and Linux (all 64bit) can be downloaded from:
